Music Mastermind is an online music quiz  created to test your music knowledge throughout all different musical genres. The idea for the quiz arose from my love of music and pub quizzes.  The quiz will be comprised of 10 random music related questions all ranging from different genres.
This website will be targeted towards any one with an interest in different types of music and are looking to test out their musical knowledge just for fun.

The aim of this project was to build a responsive website/game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website is responsive on mobile phones, tablet and desktop.

This website was created for educational purposes only.


In addition to the home page the website also features:

- The 'Begin' page;
- The `Quiz`.

The business goals for the website are;

- To provide an interactive website.
- To provide a fun and light hearted quiz.
- To allow customers to test their musical knowledge.
- To activate the brain to keep you young.
- To be able to view the website on a range of different device sizes.

The Users Goals of the website are;

- As a first time user, to be able to navigate the website easily.
- As a first time user, to have a clear understanding as to what the quiz is about.
- As a first time user, to allow the user to be able to complete the quiz without any issues.
- As a recurring or first-time visitor, to be able to restart the quiz and try beat their previous score.
- As a recurring or first-time visitor to be able to view their final score.

## Strategy

### Considering the core UX principles.

I first had to think about who my target audience would be and what would keep it simple and straightforward for them. As music pays a huge part in many people lives I felt it was a good topic to go with as it would attract a wide range of users. I decided to keep the website minimal, clutter free so that it didnt take away from the main aim of the website which is to provide a simple interactive quiz .

Music Mastermind target users are:

- All ages.
- All genders.
- People interested in Music.
- Open minded people willing to try new experiences.
- People looking to activate their brain and test their music knowledge.

What these users would be looking for:

Easy to navigate website with clear straightforward information.
-  Clear and consise questions.
- Multiple choice answered.
- A score tracker so their final result is calculated.

## Scope
As this is my is my first time working with JavaScript, I decided to keep the quiz very simple.
In order to meet the above criteria, the following features will be included in the website
- A Header when clicked will take you back to the home page
- Quiz Section containing multiple choice questions and answers
- Social network links
- A music image to go with the theme
- Control buttons to navigate the quiz

## Structure





## Skeleton
 
Please note the actual website has changed Since these wireframes. During the building process I decided to Change the content on the home page from displaying the rules to a more fun approach instead. I had originally planned on having a timer but this didn't workout within the allocated time frame.

**Home Wireframe**

**About Wireframe**

**Sign-up Wireframe**

## Surface
The website uses a simple color scheme consisting of neutral tones. The background image contains 2 music records in black which are sitting on a grey floor so I carried this throughout the website. The heading text is the same grey as the background and the color around the heading is black to compliment the music records. The container which displays the questions and answers is on a transparent background so that the music records are still visible. The color palette was created using the https://coolors.co/ website.

I used Google fonts “Marher” throughout the website as after trialing several different fonts I found this one stood out the most as it was clear and still ledable on smaller devices.
